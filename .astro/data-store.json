They shared how they made decisions on where to go out, screen recordings of the way they use google and social media and a pre-during-post night out, online mobile video diary.

This misses the point. To me, ‘Agile qual’ is less about speed per se and more about cadence. It should mean that the researcher aligns their fieldwork, analysis and reporting (format and timing) with the client’s (and / or agency’s) development schedule - so that they are in synchrony.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr/>\r\n\r\nThe concept of ‘agile’ comes from developers who wanted to take a **more iterative, experimental approach** to building software. Rather than try to craft the perfect design and then build it, they instead broke the task down into chunks, launched **‘minimal viable products’** which they develop through a series of **‘test and learn’** cycles. This relies on close collaboration and a free flow of insight and learnings between stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\u003Cbr/>\r\n\r\nTo us **‘agile online qualitative research’** means we embrace these principles and apply them to how research is gathered, interpreted and shared with clients.
