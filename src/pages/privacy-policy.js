          <p>Wherever possible, all the personal information we process is processed within the UK or European Economic Area (EEA). Some of our third-party service providers are based outside the UK or EEA so their processing of your personal information will involve a transfer outside the UK or EEA.</p>

          <p>Whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the UK or EEA, we do our best to make sure a similar degree of security of personal information by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>We will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Data Commission or UK Information Commissioner’s Office; or</li>
