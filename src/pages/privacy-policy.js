          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. What personal information we collect and how we use it</h4>

          What we need

          The company Feeling Mutual is what’s known as the ‘controller’ of the personal information you provide to us. We will usually collect basic personal information about you like your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and your payment details if you are purchasing from us.

          Sometimes we will collect other information about you such as your date of birth, gender and other details. We will be very clear with you that we wish to collect such information, our reason for collecting such information, and we would only do so with your consent.

          Why we need it

          We collect your personal information in connection with specific activities, such as campaign updates, newsletter requests, registration or membership requests, product purchases, feedback, donations, competition entries, information you provide in public forums on our sites and applications and for the purpose of research that we might invite you to.

          The information is either needed to fulfil your request or to enable us to provide you with a more personalised service. You don't have to disclose any of this information to browse our site. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

          Our marketing

          Sometimes, with your consent, we will process your personal information to provide you with information about our work or our activities that you have requested or are expecting.

          On other occasions, we may process personal information when we need to do this to fulfil a contract (for example, if you have purchased something from our web shop) or where we are required to do this by law or other regulations.

          Feeling Mutual also processes your information when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests do not override your rights. Those legitimate interests include providing you with information on our products, campaigns, services, products, newsletter requests, feedback, competitions and other activities. Please see the section on 'Legitimate Interest' for more information.

          How we obtain your details

          We will also hold information about your details so that we can respect your preferences for being contacted by us.

          We collect your personal information in a number of ways:
      <ol>
        <li>When you provide it to us directly.</li>

        <li>When you provide permission to other organisations to share it with us (including Facebook or Twitter).</li>

        <li>When we collect it as you use our websites or apps.</li>

        <li>When you have given it to a third party and you have provided permission to pass your information on to us.</li>

        <li>From publicly available sources (where possible) to keep your information up to date (e.g. the Post Office’s National Change of Address database).</li>
      </ol>
          We combine the information from these sources with the information you provide to us directly.

          From time to time we may pay for the contact details of people who might be interested in hearing from us in future. Before we purchase contact information, we always check the wording used when your information was originally collected, to make sure that we only contact people who have actively expressed an interest in receiving information from third parties.

          Please note that we will not knowingly market to or accept orders for goods or services from persons aged under 18 years.

          As a parent or guardian we encourage you to be aware of the activities in which your children are participating, both offline and online. If your children voluntarily disclose information, this may encourage unsolicited messages. We suggest that you discourage your child from providing any information without your consent.
