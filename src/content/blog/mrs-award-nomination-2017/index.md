We are delighted to have been nominated for the 2017, Market Research Society (MRS) independent consultancy award.  This was for our research into young peopleâ€™s relationships with music video for The Box Plus Network who are part owned by Channel 4.

<br/>

We used mobile qualitative research to explore the use of music video in a natural context.  We worked with a psychologist to understand the psychological needs that music video meets.  And we validated our findings through surveys with young people served through facebook advertising.
