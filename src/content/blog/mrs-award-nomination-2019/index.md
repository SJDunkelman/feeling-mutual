We are delighted to have been nominated for the 2018, MRS (Market Research Society) independent consultancy award.  This was for our work with Swingers.

<br/>

We helped Swingers evaluate the opportunity and need for local adaptation in relation to their Washington DC launch.    We did this through in-context, mobile qualitative research via Indeemo.
