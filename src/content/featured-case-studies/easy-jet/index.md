EasyJet and their ad agency VCCP wanted to understand the emotional journey of their customer and how they decide on which flight to buy. The aim was to identify the optimal role for marketing.

We recruited customers in Italy, France and the UK and asked them to complete a diary of any touchpoints that were nudging them towards a particular destination. They drew abstract pictures of how they felt and recorded key aspects of the experience of booking with us.

The work identified new opportunities for customer engagement and helped shape a new marketing and advertising campaign.
