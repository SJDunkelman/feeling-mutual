We compressed what would typically involve two stages of strategic development (first exploration then concept testing) into one phase, that ran across a week.  We recruited active users of Mac Apps in the US and UK and set a series of tasks to explore their relationship and usage of Mac Apps. This included drawings of their relationships with Mac Apps, photos of their virtual and physical desktops and screen recording site visits to Setapp and iTunes. All this revealed the insight that Setapp can help them stay productive.

The research helped inspired this hilarious advertising campaign which won a Cannes Lion Award for creativity.
