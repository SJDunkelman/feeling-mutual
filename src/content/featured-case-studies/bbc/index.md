> **“How online co-creation informed a new content strategy for Sony Electronics”**

BBC Worldwide wanted to understand how people in India share breaking news via social channels.

<br/>

We recruited people into online qualitative research and asked them to keep media diaries with screenshots of content they chose to share.  This allowed us to develop a model of behaviour, to deconstruct the factors that shape sharing and media platform choice.

<br/>

The findings were used to shape the BBC News cross-channel strategy.
