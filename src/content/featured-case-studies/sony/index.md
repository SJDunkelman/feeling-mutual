Sony Electronics wanted to develop their content strategy across social media in order to align it more tightly with brand strategy and purpose.

<br/>

We worked with the social media content agency to explore people’s needs, expectations and preferences for branded content. We did this through online qualitative research in Poland, Germany and the UK. Participants shared their favourite examples of content from different platforms and helped us optimise examples of branded content from Sony Electronics.

<br/>

From this we were able to co-create a set of creative guidelines for Sony Electronics’ content strategy and maximise the engagement of their upcoming social media content strategy.
