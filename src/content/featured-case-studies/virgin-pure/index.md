Over a two-year period, Virgin Pure (a subscription based, in-home, water purification appliance) wanted to develop a single-minded advertising proposition, improve their website sales conversion, and develop a new retention strategy.

<br/>

Our research started with a series of in-home ethnographic interviews, which uncovered the importance of ‘superior taste’ to people. This helped focus their advertising away from a multitude of other potential hero benefits.

<br/>

Then we did UX lab-testing to identify how to simplify the subscription communication and help justify the fee.

<br/>

Finally, we co-created a series of customer service and loyalty schemes with current and past customers, through asynchronous online and mobile qual.  We follow different parts of the customer experience to identify pain-points and ways to improve it.

<br/>

The ethnography inspired a new single-minded advertising strategy, the UX changes led to an uplift of more than 50% in sales conversion and the retention work resulted in a re-engineering of the customer experience and loyalty programme.
